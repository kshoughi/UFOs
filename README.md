# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the user will be able to filter based on city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
In order to use the filter criteria, the user needs to type in the value that he/she wants to see the filtered results. For example, if the user wants to see only the results from CA state, in the "Enter a State" section "ca" needs to be typed. Then, the user has to click anywhere on the page so that the resutls would be updated based on the filter criteria. Finally, the table on the right hand side of the "Filter Search" section, would show the filtered data.  

## Summary

#### Drawback:
One drawback to this design, is that the user has to follow strict rules in order to be able to use the filter criteria. For example, if a user types "US" in the "Enter a Country" section, the filter does not work since "US" is capitalized. 
#### Recommendations:
One recommendation is to allow capitallization of words so that if they typed "US" or "us", the filter would work with no problem. Another recommendation is to allow users to filter based on duration of the event.
